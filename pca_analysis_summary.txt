CUSTOMER PURCHASE BEHAVIOR - PCA ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. DATASET INFORMATION
   - Total Customers Analyzed: 10
   - Original Features: 4
   - Features: Time_spent, Clicks, Product_Views, Purchase_Frequency

2. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION RESULTS
   - Principal Components Generated: 4
   - Optimal Components (80% variance): 1
   - Data Reduction: 4 → 1 dimensions
   - Compression Ratio: 75.0%

3. VARIANCE EXPLAINED
   PC1: 99.30% (Cumulative: 99.30%)
   PC2: 0.58% (Cumulative: 99.88%)
   PC3: 0.09% (Cumulative: 99.98%)
   PC4: 0.02% (Cumulative: 100.00%)

4. KEY INSIGHTS

   a) Most Important Component (PC1):
      - Explains 99.30% of total variance
      - Represents the primary pattern in customer behavior
      
   b) Feature Importance in PC1:
      • Clicks: 0.5013
      • Product_Views: 0.5013
      • Time_spent: 0.4997
      • Purchase_Frequency: 0.4978

   c) Interpretation:
      - The features with highest absolute loadings in PC1 are the most
        influential in explaining customer purchase patterns
      - Positive loadings indicate features that increase together
      - Negative loadings indicate inverse relationships

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Use PC1 and PC2 (if needed) for customer segmentation
   - Focus on features with highest loadings for business decisions
   - The reduced dimensions can be used for clustering or classification
   - Dimensionality reduction achieved: 1 components capture
     99.3% of information
